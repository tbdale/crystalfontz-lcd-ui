===================

Description: UI with button press handler and menu system for Crystalfontz CFA635 LCD displays

This is an old project I created for an embedded "Car Computer" system I had built ( http://http://techmaim.com/?p=10 ). The code is pretty rough (hardcoded paths, minimal comments,etc) , and more of a prototype/hacker code project. The protocol translation API for the Crystalfontz CFA635 may be useful to someone.
